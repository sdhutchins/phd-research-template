# Risks and Mitigation

Use this section to think ahead about potential project failures—technical, biological, or logistical—and how you’ll respond if they emerge.

## Known Risks

- What are the top 2–3 foreseeable risks?
    - Example: Public dataset may lack full phenotype metadata.
    - Example: Method may not scale to full cohort due to runtime or memory issues.

## Mitigation Strategies

- What are the specific backup strategies if each risk occurs?
    - Example: Switch to a subset of phenotypes; use synthetic phenotypes for benchmarking.
    - Example: Profile code early and substitute lighter-weight methods.

## Dependencies

- What tools, datasets, collaborators, or timelines is your project reliant on?
    - Example: Access to controlled dbGaP dataset
    - Example: Pipeline component under active development by another lab

## Risk Evaluation Frequency

- How often will you re-assess risks and revise plans?
    - Example: Monthly during major phases; after each code sprint; before abstract deadlines.
