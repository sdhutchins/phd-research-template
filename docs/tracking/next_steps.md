# Next Actions Log

Use this log to track discrete project updates tied to actionable steps. Each entry should reflect a moment where you identified what to do next, including what assumptions to test or decisions to make.

## Entry Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]

### Immediate Tasks

- [List the next few tractable steps]
    - e.g., Run differential expression on refined sample set
    - e.g., Draft summary of tool comparisons

### Assumptions to Probe

- [What assumption or unknown are you testing next?]
    - e.g., That phenotype clustering aligns with pathway-level variation

### Decision Points

- [What choices are on the horizon? What data do you need to decide?]
    - e.g., Determine whether to integrate proteomic data at this stage

### Dependencies

- [What’s blocking progress or tied to another task/person?]
    - e.g., Waiting on ethics approval to access patient-level annotations
