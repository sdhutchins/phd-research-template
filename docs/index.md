# Research Project Documentation

A structured, science-centered template to plan, document, and evolve a research project across its full lifecycle.

## About This Template

This documentation site is built using the [PhD Research Template](https://github.com/yourusername/phd-research-template) structure. It provides a comprehensive framework for documenting research projects from hypothesis generation through results interpretation.

## Quick Navigation

- **[Research Design](research-design/overview.md)** - Conceptual framing and scientific rationale
- **[Methods](methods/data_sources.md)** - Data sources, assumptions, and analytical decisions  
- **[Results](results/summary_findings.md)** - Interpretations and findings
- **[Tracking](tracking/project_timeline.md)** - Project evolution and timelines
- **[Collaboration](collaboration/project_roles.md)** - Team roles and sustainability
- **[Glossary](glossary.md)** - Key terms and definitions

## Getting Started

1. **Customize Configuration**: Update `mkdocs.yml` with your project details
2. **Fill Core Documents**: Start with the documents in each section
3. **Update Regularly**: Keep documentation current as your research evolves
4. **Share**: Use this site to share your work with collaborators and advisors

## Template Features

- **Structured Documentation**: Organized sections for different aspects of your research
- **Version Control**: Track changes and decisions over time
- **Searchable**: Find information quickly across all documents
- **Collaboration Ready**: Easy to share with advisors and collaborators
- **Reproducible**: Clear documentation of methods and decisions

## Customization Guide

### For New Projects

1. Update the site metadata in `mkdocs.yml`:
   ```yaml
   site_name: Your Project Name
   site_author: Your Name
   repo_name: your-repo-name
   repo_url: https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name
   ```

2. Modify the navigation structure to match your project's needs

3. Add or remove sections based on your research requirements

### For Different Research Types

- **Computational Research**: Add sections for code documentation, algorithms, and computational methods
- **Experimental Research**: Add sections for protocols, equipment, and experimental procedures
- **Clinical Research**: Add sections for patient data, clinical protocols, and regulatory compliance

## Template Structure

This template follows a systematic approach to research documentation:

- **Research Design**: Conceptual framework and scientific rationale
- **Methods**: Data sources, analytical approaches, and technical decisions
- **Results**: Findings, interpretations, and communication strategies
- **Tracking**: Project management, timelines, and decision logs
- **Collaboration**: Team structure, roles, and sustainability planning
