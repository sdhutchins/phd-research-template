# Summary of Findings

Use this document to synthesize core results. Focus on clarity and interpretation rather than raw output.

## Key Results

- What are the main findings so far?
    - e.g., “Variants in mitochondrial genes are enriched in unaffected carriers.”
    - e.g., “Module 3 (immune-related) is inversely associated with disease severity.”

## Statistical and Biological Relevance

- Which results are statistically significant, and how were they tested?
- What is their biological meaning or implication?
- Do findings align with prior literature, or do they suggest a new mechanism?
