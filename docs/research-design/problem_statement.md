# Problem Statement

Clearly articulating your problem sets the foundation for hypothesis generation, methodological decisions, and project relevance. This section should state the core research question in precise, technical terms.

## Core Question

- What specific biological or computational question are you trying to answer?
    - Example: “Can regulatory variant burden in immune-modulating genes explain unaffected carrier status in heritable PAH?”

## Scientific Context

- What is known or debated about this problem?
- Why is this question unresolved or insufficiently answered by existing methods or data?
- Are there specific gaps in modeling, inference, interpretability, or integration?

## Timeliness and Relevance

- Why is this problem pressing now (e.g., new data availability, unmet clinical need, recent methodological advances)?
- What downstream implications would solving this problem have for science, health, or technology?

## Fit and Scope

- What boundary conditions define this project (e.g., organism, disease model, data type)?
- How does the question align with broader themes in the field (e.g., rare variant interpretation, multimodal integration)?
- Are there specific populations, datasets, or mechanistic contexts that are particularly relevant?
