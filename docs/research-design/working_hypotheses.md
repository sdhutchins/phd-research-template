# Working Hypotheses

This section frames your projectâ€™s guiding testable ideas. Each hypothesis should be clearly stated and falsifiable, grounded in prior knowledge or theory. Consider how each might be tested, refined, or rejected as evidence accumulates.

## Primary Hypothesis

- What is your main mechanistic or predictive claim?
    - Example: "Variants in chromatin remodeling genes reduce penetrance in known monogenic disorders."
    - Example: "Pathway-level differential activity in WNT signaling distinguishes disease subtypes."

## Alternative Hypotheses

- What competing or secondary explanations are plausible?
    - Example: "Noncoding regulatory variation explains observed expression shifts."
    - Example: "Technical artifact or population structure, not true biological signal, drives association."

## Falsifiability Criteria

- What type of result would falsify each hypothesis?
    - Example: Lack of enrichment in expected gene sets under multiple models.
    - Example: No signal in matched control datasets or independent validation cohort.
    - Example: Failure to reproduce pathway signal across multiple quantification methods.
