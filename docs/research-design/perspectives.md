# Project Perspective

This section encourages you to reflect on the implicit and explicit viewpoints shaping the research. Scientific
questions are often framed through a particular disciplinary, institutional, or societal lens. Being precise about
perspective sharpens relevance and ethical clarity.

## Primary Viewpoint

- Is the study primarily designed from the standpoint of a computational biologist, clinician, patient advocate, geneticist, or systems biologist?
- What questions are foregrounded due to this disciplinary lens?
- How might this affect data prioritization, interpretation, or tool development?

## Stakeholders and Impact

- Who stands to benefit from this research (e.g., patients with rare disease, public health agencies, translational researchers)?
- Are there populations or use cases that may be marginalized or less well-served?
- Have user needs, equity, or accessibility concerns shaped design decisions?

## Alternate Perspectives

- How would the experimental design, metrics of success, or outputs shift if the project were driven by a different audience (e.g., regulators, ethicists, industry)?
- What blind spots or assumptions emerge when viewed from another domain (e.g., social determinants of health, environmental exposures)?
- Are there interdisciplinary opportunities or tensions that need to be navigated?
