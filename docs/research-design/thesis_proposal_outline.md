# Thesis Proposal Outline

This document provides a structured overview of your proposed research, modeled after NIH-style or institutional templates. Each section should be drafted with clarity, scientific rigor, and explicit rationale.

## 1. Background and Significance

- What biological or computational problem does your work address?
- Why is this an important and timely problem?
- How does your work build on, differ from, or fill gaps in existing literature?

## 2. Specific Aims

- What are the 2â€“3 central aims that drive your project?
    - Aim 1: [e.g., Identify functional variants using integrated regulatory annotations]
    - Aim 2: [e.g., Prioritize druggable pathways using expression and graph-based methods]

## 3. Preliminary Data

- What early analyses, simulations, or observations support your proposal?
- Include any pilot studies, existing cohorts, or code prototypes.

## 4. Research Strategy

### Approach

- What methods will you use to address each aim?
- What datasets, tools, and benchmarks will you rely on?

### Pitfalls and Alternatives

- What are the known risks in your design or analysis pipeline?
- What contingency plans or backup methods will you use?

## 5. References

- Include key primary literature, methods papers, and datasets you rely on.
- Format can follow journal or proposal-specific citation norms.
