# Design Type

- [ ] Experimental (intervention applied with random assignment)
- [ ] Quasi-experimental (non-random assignment, matched groups, or natural comparison)
- [ ] Observational (no intervention, passive measurement)

## Design Rationale

- Why is this design appropriate?
- What limitations come with it?
- What might improve internal validity?
- How does this affect causal claims?

## Control Strategy

- What are you comparing?
- What are the key threats to validity (bias, confounding)?
- How are you addressing them?
