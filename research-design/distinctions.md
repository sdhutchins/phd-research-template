# Key Distinctions

Carefully defining your categorical boundaries ensures clarity in analysis, interpretation, and reproducibility. This section should surface how you’re drawing scientific lines and the implications of those choices.

## Core Categories

- What major distinctions are you drawing?
    - Example: Case vs. control; affected vs. unaffected carriers; treated vs. untreated
    - Example: Driver variants vs. modifier variants; coding vs. regulatory elements
    - Example: Early-onset vs. late-onset cases; cell type A vs. cell type B

## In-Scope (as of YYYY-MM-DD)

- What’s currently included in your study’s scope?
    - Example: BMPR2 mutation carriers sequenced with >30x WGS
    - Example: Variants in genes with immune pathway annotation in GO or KEGG
    - Example: Bulk RNA-seq from patient-derived fibroblasts in untreated state

## Out-of-Scope (as of YYYY-MM-DD)

- What is currently excluded, and why?
    - Example: Pediatric samples due to consent restrictions
    - Example: Functional assays requiring CRISPR validation
    - Example: Single-cell resolution analysis (to be reserved for future aims)

## Risks of Current Boundaries

- What are the analytical, ethical, or interpretive risks of the distinctions you’re drawing?
    - Example: Bias due to uneven population sampling across case/control
    - Example: Risk of excluding informative rare variants by current filter thresholds
    - Example: Potential misclassification of modifiers as noise due to lack of phenotypic resolution
