# Analysis Plan

This section outlines your planned analyses and statistical reasoning. It serves as a roadmap for turning raw data into interpretable results.

## Core Questions

- What are the main hypotheses or questions you are testing?
    - Example: “Do expression outliers cluster in enhancer-linked genes in the disease group?”
- Are there secondary analyses, subgroup evaluations, or exploratory components?

## Design Justification

- Why is your study design appropriate for the analysis?
    - Example: “We use a quasi-experimental design with matched controls to reduce confounding.”
- Are you using repeated measures, batch correction, or stratification?

## Methods Overview

- What statistical or computational methods will you use?
    - Examples: DESeq2, mixed-effects models, PCA, Bayesian models, permutation tests
- How will you control for multiple testing or reduce dimensionality?

## Dependencies and Assumptions

- What assumptions does your analysis rely on (e.g., normality, independence, linearity)?
- Are there known data limitations (e.g., batch effects, missing values, unbalanced groups)?
- How will you test or account for violations?

## Power and Sample Considerations (optional)

- Is there a power analysis? If not, why?
- Minimum sample size required to detect a meaningful effect?
