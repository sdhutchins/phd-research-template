# PhD Research Template

This repository provides a structured, systems-thinking template for organizing a PhD research project. It was created to support Qualifying Exam (QE) preparation, help clarify scientific reasoning, and document how ideas, methods, and decisions evolve over time. It is designed to reduce fragmentation across notebooks, documents, and email threads by offering a durable, modular structure that can scale with the complexity of your work.

Each folder corresponds to a core function in the research lifecycle: defining the scientific problem, designing the analysis, documenting results, managing collaboration, and tracking iteration.

## 📁 research-design/

Captures the scientific rationale, conceptual model, and evolving questions.

- `overview.md` – Title, phase, collaborators, and scope
- `problem_statement.md` – Core scientific question and rationale
- `working_hypotheses.md` – Primary/alternate hypotheses and how to falsify them
- `system_structure.md` – Levels of analysis, unit of study, system boundaries
- `distinctions.md` – Defined categories (e.g., case/control), in-/out-of-scope boundaries
- `mental_model.md` – Diagram or narrative of your working model and assumptions
- `perspectives.md` – Stakeholder views, who benefits, who is excluded
- `knowledge_gaps.md` – Gaps in the literature or field
- `unanswered_questions.md` – Hypotheses or models not yet tested
- `thesis_proposal_outline.md` – Structured outline for your QE proposal

## 📁 methods/

Outlines analytic plans, tool selection, assumptions, and reproducibility strategy.

- `analysis_plan.md` – High-level plan for each aim or hypothesis
- `method_assumptions.md` – Assumptions embedded in design or inference
- `pipeline_decisions.md` – Summary of analysis pipeline structure
- `tool_comparisons.md` – Tools considered, used, or rejected with justifications
- `controls_and_nulls.md` – Baselines, control logic, and null model notes
- `data_sources.md` – Metadata and notes on datasets used or referenced
- `ethics_equity_practicalities.md` – Bias, inclusion, sovereignty, and compute access
- `data_and_software_doc.md` – Codebase, containers, file formats, software used

## 📁 results/

Collects major findings, interpretations, and framing aids for communication.

- `summary_findings.md` – Key discoveries and supporting evidence
- `interpretation_notes.md` – Relevance to hypotheses and field context
- `audience_pitches.md` – Tailored summaries for expert, general, or clinical audiences
- `metaphors_and_visuals.md` – Narrative, visual, or metaphorical framing tools
- `deferred_features.md` – Future directions, modular extensions, or postponed analyses

## 📁 collaboration/

Tracks contributor roles, review points, and continuity planning.

- `project_roles.md` – Mapping of PI, co-PI, student, postdoc, etc.
- `review_calendar.md` – Timeline of internal reviews and committee check-ins
- `handoff_plan.md` – Continuity planning in case of transition or absence
- `sustainability_notes.md` – Post-graduation or post-publication stewardship plans

## 📁 tracking/

Captures change over time: decisions, risks, feedback, and next steps.

- `iteration_log.csv` – Date-stamped changes to design, methods, framing, or assumptions
- `key_decisions.md` – Log of high-impact decisions and justifications
- `risks_and_mitigation.md` – Known or anticipated bottlenecks with mitigation plans
- `next_steps.md` – Short-term actions that advance the project
- `committee_feedback_log.md` – Notes from QE prep or committee feedback cycles
- `project_timeline.md` – Chronological roadmap of project phases, milestones, and deadlines

## Glossary of Key Concepts

**Working Hypothesis**  
A specific, testable statement of what you expect based on your model of the system.

**System Structure**  
The interacting biological, computational, or regulatory components of your study—e.g., variant → gene → pathway → phenotype.

**Distinctions**  
Explicit boundaries you define—what's in scope, what's out, and how categories like case/control or modifier/driver are assigned.

**Mental Model**  
Your internal concept of how the system works, usually structured as logic, a schematic, or narrative.

**Null Model**  
A baseline or control model used to determine whether observed effects differ from randomness or expectation.

**Perspective**  
The implicit or explicit point of view driving the study—e.g., clinical, statistical, systems biology.

**Iteration Log**  
A living document that tracks conceptual, methodological, and practical shifts across the life of the project.

This structure is meant to evolve with your thinking. It’s not just for documentation—it's a scaffold for clarity, strategy, and accountability.
